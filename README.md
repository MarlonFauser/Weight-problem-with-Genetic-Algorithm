# Weight problem with Genetic Algorithm
Solving weight problem using genetic algorithm (GAs).

## Problem
Implement a genetic algorithm which provide the best answer for this problem.
Take the best items, considering the weight of each of them by your own score without exceed the limit of 30kg.

## Inputs

### Initial population

A1 -> {1,0,0,1,1,0}

A2 -> {0,0,1,1,1,0}

A3 -> {0,1,0,1,0,0}

A4 -> {0,1,1,0,0,1}

### Max weight

30kg

### Items

| Item         | weight | score |
| ------------ | ------ | ----- |
| Sleeping bag | 15     | 15    |
| Rope         | 3      | 7     |
| Switchblade  | 2      | 10    |
| Torch        | 5      | 5     |
| Bottle       | 9      | 8     |
| Food         | 20     | 17    |
